          A FreeBSD rootkit written in <span className="text-amber-400 font-bold">C</span>.
          This repository contains my extensive writeup of the entire process. This
          was a university project where the focus was on consistent documentation
          of the research process, detailing how you got from the beginning of
          the project to the end.

        <p>
          The rootkit operates as a 'support' system for another hypothetical
          virus. It aims to completely hide a file from the operating system
          by hijacking the relevant system calls to ignore a hardcoded file
          name value. This includes hiding it from file size calculations, etc.
          There was a partial implementation of it hiding itself from a
          Host-based Intrusion Detection System, but this was incomplete.
